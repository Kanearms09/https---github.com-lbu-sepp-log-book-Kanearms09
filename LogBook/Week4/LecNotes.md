**Agile-**

"Able to move (esp. climb or manoeuvre) quickly and easily; nimble, dexterous"


#### Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

-**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
-**Working software** over comprehensive documentation
-**Customer collaborations** over contract negotiation
-**Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.


**Word Play**

A subtle point is that "Agile" here is an adjective, and not a noun. If you prefer, "Agile" is not a thing, it is a way of doing a thing. So, we cannot "Do Agile", but we can "Work in an Agile Way". That's really important. Remember the definition

We often hear mention of Agile methodology, this is an Oxymoron as a methodology is a rigid structure of doing something, Agile by definition is not.

#### Bad & Good agile


**Bad Agile**

Per Dave Thomas:

Post-Manifesto, "Agile" became a buzzword, and guess what?

- There are "Agile" consultants
- "Agile" conferences
- Books explaining how to do "Agile"

Dave argues that we should drop "Agile", and talk about "Agility" instead.

Consultants and businesses are always going to be looking to sell something, certifications test something.


**Good Agile**

How to work in an agile manner:

- Find out where you are
- Take a small step towards your goal
- Adjust your understanding based on what you just learned
- Repeat

The overall message is that, unless we're careful, "Agile" just turns into Waterfall.

Good Agile for software development features:

- A self-organising team
- A rough plan, that can be changed
- A rough architecture, that likewise can be changed.

#### Agility

As "Agile" as a term is now meaningless. Here is how to be Agile now:

- Iterative Development - A software development method that involves breaking a project into smaller cycles, or iterations.

- Time-Boxing - A time management technique  that involves setting a specific time limit for a task.

- Empirical Process Control - A management approach that relies on observation, experimentation, and adaptation to manage complex and unpredictable processes.

- Value-Based Prioritisation - A method for prioritising tasks and projects based on their value to the user or business

- Self-Organisation - A team structure where developers have the autonomy to decide how to best approach their work.

- Collaboration - A process where multiple members of a development team work together, sharing ideas, knowledge and code to build a software product.


**Practicality in Agile**

One of the first things that should be done is documenting user requirements for the product, this can be articulated as Epics or user stories. You can grade each user story as to its importance to the project, and create a prioritised list.

Grading can be done in a number of ways:

- Planning Poker
- Animal Estimating
- or, Doggy Estimating

This allows us to remove any sort of social bias when speaking our mind on your beliefs on a project importance, especially under the over-sight of a senior dev.


**Sprints**

We also should work in short sprints, every sprint delivers a shippable product, and therefore value. Every sprint focuses on the currently most important needs. And each one is followed by a retrospective.

When grading each requirement of importance, we delegate points to each requirement based on how important they are. When we work out the amount of points that can be done in each sprint this is known as the velocity. Thus we can reliably forecast when the project will be completed.


**Self-Managing Teams**

Trust the team to manage itself, allow the team to do what works best for the team. foster specialist- generalists to ensure cover, and treat outcomes as the output of the team rather than the individual.

There are no "Managers" as such, they are more known as "servant leaders". Management should be about making the team as productive as possible, not about "managing".


**Tracking Work**

Work can be tracked as tasks move between stages. The tracking can be done in an online tool such as GitHub projects, Trello or Jira. Or it can be a bunch of Post-It notes stuck to the wall in the office. Whatever, the tool will visually track the project progress as tasks move across.

The hope is that work will march beautifully across the swim-lane "board".


**Work in Progress**

A user story in Testing but not complete waste, basically, Kanban limits how much work can be at each stage. So it helps "pull" work to the right, rather than relying on it being "pushed" from the left.

Kanban is an idea from manufacturing, suppose you have a machine that makes widgets from thingies, and needs 100 thingies an hour at full capacity. There is no point running the machine that makes thingies to make more than 100 an hour, even if it can.


**Scrum**

The most widely used approach to "Agile" is probably "Scrum". which we will meet later on. Scrum is framework, not a methodology. Although you will find millions of Google hits
that say it is the latter. Most organisations use something that is much more informal, which is good because it shows agility.


**Lean**

Lean isa much more flexible approach, focused on developing innovative digital products. it works off of the following formula:

Build --> Measure --> Learn

It then iterates back to the beginning, we will learn more about this in future lectures


**Terminology**

We have used a lot of new and testable terminology in this lecture, here is a slight breakdown of the new terms:

- Requirements:

-Epic - This is a large functionality requirement that is too big to complete within a single sprint

-User Story - A concise description of a desired feature or functionality from the perspective of the end user

-Persona - The supposed personality and background story of the user that helps define their needs


- Estimating:

-Planning Poker - A consensus-based planing and estimating technique used to assess the priority of each feature


- Teams:

-Self-Organising - Teams that organise themselves based on their own perspective of their own strengths and weaknesses.

-generalist-specialist - People who have a large capability across lots of general fields within software, as to not hinder progress with the appearance of an engineer.

-Servant-leader - The person who prioritises the needs of others, putting their teams well-being and development above their own.


- From Scrum:

-OODA - A decision making framework which outlines a cycle of continuously gathering info, analysing it to understand the situation, making a decision based on that under-standing, and then taking action.

-Sprint - A designated length of time delegated to solving an issue within the development requirements

-Backlog - This is the changing list of requirements based off of a users needs

-Retrospective - This is a meeting where a team reflects on their work and plans on how to improve on it.

-Scrum Master - This is the facilitator and
coach who helps a team work efficiently using the Scrum.


- Form Lean:

-Pivot - A strategic course correction where a company significantly alters its business model, product, or target market based on customer feedback and learnings

-(validated) learning - The process of testing your business hypotheses with real customers, gathering data from their feedback, and using that information to confirm or disprove your assumptions about the product or service.
