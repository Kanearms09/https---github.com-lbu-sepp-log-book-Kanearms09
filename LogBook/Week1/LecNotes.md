### Lecture 1 -Intro

**Software engineering -**
(According to WikiPedia)

Software engineering is a field within computer science focused on designing, developing, testing and maintaining software applications. It involves applying engineering principles and computer programming expertise to develop software systems that meet user needs.

However there is not really software engineers anymore, now they are usually referred to as Devs (Junior & Senior)

#### Types of Software Engineer

**Back-end**

Concerned with server side operations, usually in 3GLs such as Java, Python & PHP

**Front-end**

Concerned with client side development, usually in WebDev languages such as HTML, CSS & JavaScript

#### The command line

IDE's are extremely convenient to use and are a big time-saver, however they are not permanent and tend to be outdated very quickly. The command line however, never changes. The modern day Linux machine has pretty much the same interface as the Unix system of the 1970s. So it is very important to learn your git command line commands, as they will likely be the same in the future when your IDE will not.

#### Technical knowledge

A Dev would be expected to have a firm understanding of the following:

- DataBases & SQL
- Basic Networking (HTTP requests, TCP, IDP etc)
- Basic principles of UX & UI (User Experience, User Interface)

However, these days you will also likely be expected to have some understanding of the following also:

- Cloud
- Virtualisation and Containers (Virtual machines etc)
- CI/CD pipelines (Continuous integration & Continuous deployment)

#### New terminology that might come in use:


- **Kanban boards** - All the work summarised into tasks and written on post it notes. These notes are then catergorised into to do, in progress, done and approved.

- **TDD** - Test Driven Development. This is the process of writing tests for the software to pass before the software has been created.

- **BDD** - Behaviour Driven Development. This is a methodology that emphasises collaboration between all parties involved in product development.

- **Cruft/Crufty** - This means that a piece of software works but not as efficiently as it could.

- **Banjaxed/Borked** - This means that a piece of software is broken or not properly functioning

- **PICNIC** - This stands for Problem In Chair Not In Computer
