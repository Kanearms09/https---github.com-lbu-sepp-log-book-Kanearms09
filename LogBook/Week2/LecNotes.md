### Lecture 2 -Tools of the trade

#### Common programming languages

As per the JetBrains 2024 Dev Ecosystem, the most commonly used programming languages are as follows:

1. JavaScript (massive)
2. Python (still slowly increasing)
3. Java (pretty static at around 50% of devs using it)
4. C++ (quite static)
5. C (also quite static)

also most Devs also use HTML/CSS and SQL.

We can see that if we continue down the this survey, the languages to know for high salaries are:

- Scala
- Go
- Kotlin
- C
- C++

We also gain other little bits of useful information from the same survey, as such:

- 60% of Devs use Mac or Linux
- 85% of Devs mainly use laptops
- 93% of Devs customise their IDE
- 60%+ of Development is for web
- 75% of a Devs time is spent on code

In terms of what is the most popular IDES, StackOverflow tells us:

- 74% use VS Code
- about the same amount use some type of JetBrains IDE
- 23% claim to use Notepad ++

As mentioned, the common theme is for a dev to use their laptop mainly. It is likely that the laptop would be linked to monitors at some sort of desk. The workflow for a developer producing code will likely follow this pattern:

1. Clone the code
2. Modify the code
3. Review, and push the code

#### Working with a team

One issue that a team will have to face is that it is unlikely for them to be colocated, however it's still extremely important to maintain the tracking of progress, recording tasks, sharing code etc.

In the jargon, we are looking at CSCW, which means Computer Supported Collaborative Working. This is useful when considering the teams that are:

- In the same place at the same time
- In the same place but at different times
- In different places at the same time
- In different places at different times

StackOverflow shows some tools which are useful when dealing with the issue of a lack of colocation when working on code, the top five appearing to be:

- Jira
- Confluence
- A Markdown File
- Trello
- GitHub

However sometimes despite these issues, some meetings are unavoidable. We will see examples of this when looking at some Agile Frameworks which are based around regular, short meetings, which will usually be hybrid (online and in-person).

To help us with these hybrid meetings, the StackOverflow survey provides us with a number of work arounds for this issue:

- MS Teams
- Slack
- Zoom
- Discord
- Google Meets

It is important to have a firm understanding of these tools, from data we can see that the bulk of meetings have this online component:

- 42% Hybrid
- 38% Fully Remote
- 20% Fully in-person

#### Some Tools we should nod wisely about

As you can see this is a lot of information to take in, here are some of the key tools that you should have a basic if not developed understanding of:


**Teams**
This is a part of Office 365.

After starting on unstable ground in 2020, it is now a dominant tool - likely because so many businesses already have Office 365.


**Slack**
This is a collaborative tool with chats, meetings and more.

As most of these things, the business model is Freemium (Free but can be upgraded).


**Trello**
Trello us a simple, but powerful, tool based on creating online "Boards" or "Cards"

It is also a Freemium model


**GitHub**
Finally, a nod to GitHub.

There is a lot on Github that we have never touched on: project boards and wikis, for example.

Github **is** your CV.
