### Topic Use Cases

#### CI/CD

1. **Automated Testing Pipeline**

Every code push triggers tests (unit, integration, security) to catch bugs early before they hit production.


2. **Frequent, Small Releases**

Instead of Big, risky updates every few months, teams push updates daily or weekly with confidence.


3. **Rollback Support**

Failed deployments can automatically be reverted to the previous working version.


4. **Consistent Builds Across Teams**

CI/CD ensures the same build processes on all machines, reducing the variability in issues from computer to computer within the machine.


5. **Faster Feedback Loops**

Developers get quick feedback when something breaks, allowing faster debugging and better productivity.

#### DevOps

1. **Infastructure as Code (IaC)**

Automating infastructure provisioning with tools like Terraform improves consistency and reduces human error


2. **Monitoring and Logging**

real-time logs and metrics (using tools such as Prometheus) help us detect issues before users do.


3. **Collaboration Between Dev and Ops**

Shared responsibility for deployment, uptime, and scalability breaks down silos between teams.


4. **Automated Scaling and Load Balancing**

DevOps practices enable auto-scaling based on usage, saving money during off-peak hours.


5. **Continuous Improvement Culture**

DevOps encourages teams to reflect and improve constantly through retrospective and incident post-mortems.

#### Lean Approach to Software

1. **MVP development**

Build just enough to test ideas and get feedback early, instead of building a huge product that might not have been as successful as you wished.


2. **Customer-Driven Development**

Prioritise features based on user feedback and analytics, not just assumptions.


3. **Reduced Waste**

Avoid over-engineering or writing code that doesn't directly solve a user problem.


4. **Rapid Iteration**

Lean encourages frequent releases, so teams can learn what works and what doesn't.


5. **Cross-functional Teams**

Lean promotes teamwork across dev, QA, design and product to deliver value to a customer.
