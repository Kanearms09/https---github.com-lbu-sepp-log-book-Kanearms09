#### Scrum - brief history  

Scrum has its origins in the mid 1980s, when Takeuchi and Nonaka published work on the parallels between team sports and teamwork in product development. This work was based on looking at how successful manufacturing businesses adopted agile approaches to new product development. 

Takeuchi and Nonaka draw parallels with many team sports, notably rugby. They also noted that successful business teams have certain properties:

- **Autonomy**: self-organised and empowered 
- **Cross-fertalisation**: having within the team all skills required 
- **Self-transendence**: elevating goals and pushing beyond the norm

In 1996, Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber considered the work previously mentioned and on top of this created the modern day Scrum as a Software development method. This was written in the original Scrum book, however it is extremely opinionated in its beliefs in there never being a place for the waterfall methodology. In summary the Scrum method ideology if you will can be summed up in the term OODA:

**O**bserve
**O**rient
**D**ecide 
**A**ct

Here is the Scrum framework summarised in a diagram, note that the colours of the people are important:

At first glance this diagram may appear quite confusing, however the easiest way to understand it is too break it down into 3 elements:

- The principles 
- The roles 
- The meetings 


#### Principles

The underlying ideas of Scrum we have encountered before within the agile philosophy: 

- iterative Development 
- Empirical Process Control
- Self Organisation 
- Time Boxing 
- Value-based Prioritisation 
- Collaboration 


#### Roles

Within the team there is a number of roles we can have:

- Product Owner 
- Scrum Master 
- Scrum Team 

However there are external influences also:

- Customer 
- Other Stakeholders 

Here is some more detailed descriptions of the roles within the actual team:


**Product Owner**

The role of this person is to essentially bring the stated and unstated customer needs required to be fulfilled in order for the developers to create a product the customer would be happy with. They play a very important role in the maintenance and fulfilment of the company vision. 

**Scrum Master**

A Scrum Masters key priority is to provide an environment for the Scrum Team that is sufficient enough for them to create a viable product. They are also responsible for ensuring that proper Scrum practice is maintained within all aspects of product development. It is based upon the principles of servant leadership. 

**Scrum Team**

This is the developers responsible for producing the working product. They tend to be generalist-specialist, this allows teams to avoid set backs caused by unforecasted disruption to team availability. The team is independent, customer-centric, collaborative and ideally co-located 


#### Scrum initiation 

To begin a Scrum project, a Stakeholder meeting is held to predefine the project vision in mind. It is the POs responsibility to listen to the insights of this meeting and form a Priorities Project Backlog, which considers project requirements and the necessity of providing one over another first, this is done in the form of User Stories. 

As mentioned we must first define a project vision, This is often a statement that encapsulates the business needs, in a stylised format:

for (target customer)
who (customer needs)
the (product name)
is a (product category)
that (the key benefit, or reason to buy)
unlike (the primary competing alternative)
our product (statement of primary differentiation)


#### Progress tracking 

This is an extremely visual process, often consisting of user stories that are managed on a Scrum Board. The completion of tasks can be monitored on a Burndown Chart and product backlog, using both can allow for a accurate forecast of team velocity. 


#### Sprints

A sprint is a specific period of work, the duration of a sprint can vary however they usually sit at the 1-4 week mark. The aim of every sprint is to eventually provide a shippable product that has some required functionality. The spec of the sprint is defined within the Scrum Team as an aspect of their own self-organisation. 

A sprint is initiated with a sprint planning meeting which consider the Prioritised Product Backlog, and commits to the set of User Stories for the sprint. From here you can prioritise in order of necessity the sprints you will do. 

With the team  now highly focussed on sprint tasks, the worst thing to happen would be communication and confusion with a customer. Therefore the customer can only communicate its needs with the PO. This way the PO can groom the backlog of sprint tasks in order to keep a customer happy. 

The daily stand-up refers to a 15 minute progress meeting that is at the start of each date. You go round the room and each team member will state their progress, plans and impediments which are noted and fixed by the Scrum Master. 

The final aspect of a sprint is a sprint review meeting, here the PO will run over the deliverables made within the sprint and confirms acceptance. This is ended with a sprint retrospective where the team will consolidate their work, note possible improvements and apply lessons learnt to future sprints, both are time-boxed. 

Similarly after complete product development is complete, the project concludes with a Retrospective Project Meeting that evaluates the project and provides reccomendations to improve future projects, like all scrum meetings these are also time-boxed.
